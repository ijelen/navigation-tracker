# registration-tracker
A simple React web app that tracks expiration date of a list of vehicles and warns a user. Itâ€™s bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and built using [react-admin](https://github.com/marmelab/react-admin) and Material-UI. Data storage and user authentification is handled by Firebase.
