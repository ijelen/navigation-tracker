# Expiry-tracker
A web app that tracks expiry date of a list of items and warns a user. Itâ€™s bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and built using [react-admin](https://github.com/marmelab/react-admin) and Material-UI. Data storage, user authentification and file storage are handled by Firebase. The app uses Mailgun for transactional email and Firebase serverless functions to schedule mail delivery to the user.
